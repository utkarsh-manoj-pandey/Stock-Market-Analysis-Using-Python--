![Stock Prediction](stock_prediction.jpg)

Welcome to the Stock Prediction project! In this project, I leveraged Python's powerful data analysis and visualization libraries to extract, analyze, and visualize stock market data, gaining valuable insights into the performance of leading companies.

## Project Overview 🚀

The project's primary objective was to analyze the historical performance of four prominent companies: Apple, Google, Microsoft, and Amazon. By sourcing data from Yahoo Finance, I aimed to uncover trends, assess risk, and enhance decision-making capabilities in the financial markets.

## Key Tasks and Achievements 📊

### 1. Data Collection and Cleaning
I retrieved stock data directly from Yahoo Finance, ensuring data cleanliness and reliability.

### 2. Change in Stock Price Over Time
I visualized changes in stock prices over time, providing a comprehensive view of each company's stock performance.

### 3. Volume of Stock Trading
I plotted the volume of stocks traded over time, identifying patterns and trends that impact trading activity.

### 4. Moving Averages
Calculated and visualized moving averages to gain insights into the long-term trends of stock prices.

### 5. Daily Returns Analysis
Computed daily returns for each stock to assess their daily profitability and volatility.

### 6. Trend Analysis
Introduced a 'Trend' column based on daily returns, visualizing trend frequencies through pie charts for each company.

### 7. Correlation Analysis
Explored the correlation between the daily returns of different stocks, providing insights into diversification potential.
